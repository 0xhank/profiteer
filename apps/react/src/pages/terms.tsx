## RISK WARNING
The value of Digital Assets can fluctuate significantly and there is a material risk of economic loss when buying, selling, holding or investing in Digital Assets. You should therefore consider whether trading or holding Digital Assets is suitable for you taking into account your personal circumstances, financial or otherwise.

Please ensure that you fully understand the risks involved before using the Profiteer Platform and Profiteer Services.

You acknowledge that we are not your broker, intermediary, agent or advisor and we have no fiduciary relationship or obligation to you in connection with any activities you undertake when using the Profiteer Platform. We do not and are not providing any investment or consulting advice and no communication or information that we provide to you is intended to be, or should be construed as, advice of any kind.

You are responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy or related transaction is appropriate for you in light of your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance and you are responsible for any associated loss or liability. We do not recommend that any Digital Asset should be bought, earned, sold or held by you. Before making the decision to buy, sell or hold any Digital Asset, you should conduct your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor. We are not responsible for the decisions you make to buy, sell or hold Digital Assets based on the information or services provided by us, including any losses you incur arising from those decisions.

## 6. Accessing the Profiteer Platform
6.1. To access the Profiteer Platform you must have the necessary equipment (such as a computer or smartphone) and access to the internet. You can access the Profiteer Platform through the use of bots or otherwise as we may permit from time to time.

6.2. The use of the Platform and other access methods may be subject to such additional terms as we require from time to time and shall communicate to you.

## 7. Transactions
7.1. You acknowledge and agree that where you execute any Transaction with Improper Intent and/or in the case of Manifest Error, Profiteer is authorised by you (without any payment or penalty or liability due by Profiteer and provided that such action is in compliance with Applicable Law) to cancel/void such Transaction (to the extent possible), take such actions as Profiteer may reasonably deem fit and treat such Transaction as if they had never been entered into.

7.2. We may be required under these Terms or Applicable Law to share information about your activities on the Profiteer Platform with third parties and within the Profiteer Group. You acknowledge and agree that we are entitled to disclose such information.

We are not required to verify the accuracy, authenticity or validity of any Instruction and will not monitor or reject Instructions on the basis that they are, or appear to be, duplicates. However, if we are in doubt as to the accuracy, authenticity or validity of an Instruction, we may refuse to act upon or defer acting upon any Instruction, or seek further information with respect to the Instruction.

8.2. Instructions are irrevocable and therefore once an Instruction has been submitted you have no right to rescind or withdraw it without our written consent. Your Instruction is not deemed to be received by us until it has been received by our server. Our record of all Instructions will be conclusive and binding on you for all purposes.

8.3. By submitting an Instruction you are authorising us to initiate the Transaction.

If you have insufficient Digital Assets in your Wallet to effect the Transaction (i.e. less than the required amount to settle the Transaction and to pay all the fees associated with the Transaction), then we have the right to refuse to effect any Transaction. Profiteer may also refuse to act on instructions to the extent permitted by these Terms. It is your responsibility to hold sufficient Digital Assets in your Wallet.

8.4. You are aware that Instructions and information transmitted on the Platform or by email are generally transmitted via the internet and may be routed via public, transnational installations which are not specifically protected. We cannot guarantee that the Instructions and information transmitted will be completely protected against unauthorised access, and you accept the associated risks.

In particular, we and any Profiteer Affiliate may from time to time act in more than one capacity, and in those capacities we may receive fees or commissions from more than one user (including you).

26. Governing law
Aside from where Applicable Law requires or provides you with a choice otherwise, these Terms (including this arbitration agreement) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of England.

27. Dispute Resolution
27.1. Please contact Profiteer first if you have any concerns with the Services. We would like to address your concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings, if possible. We will attempt to resolve the dispute internally as soon as possible. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith for a period of one month to resolve the dispute (which discussions shall remain confidential and be subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as evidence in any legal proceeding).

27.2. In the event the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, and you wish to assert a Claim against Profiteer, then you agree to set forth the basis of such Claim in writing in a "Notice of Claim," as a form of prior notice to Profiteer. The Notice of Claim must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, (ii) set out the specific relief sought, (iii) include your Wallet reference. The Notice of Claim should be submitted to Customer Support. After you have provided the Notice of Claim to Profiteer, the dispute referenced in the Notice of Claim may be submitted by either Profiteer or you to arbitration in accordance with the below clause (Agreement to Arbitrate).

27.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the submission of a dispute to Profiteer for resolution internally and the delivery of a Notice of Claim to Profiteer are prerequisites to commencement of an arbitration proceeding (or any other legal proceeding).

27.4. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Profiteer shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.

27.5. Aside from where Applicable Law requires or provides you with a choice otherwise, you and Profiteer agree that, subject to the immediately preceding clause above (Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period), any Claim shall be determined by mandatory final and binding individual (not class) arbitration administered by the London Court of International Arbitration ("LCIA") in accordance with the LCIA Rules for the time being in force, which rules are deemed incorporated by reference in this clause.

27.10. The arbitration provisions set forth in this clause will survive termination of these Terms.

27.11. Any arbitration against Profiteer must be commenced by filing and serving a Notice of Arbitration in accordance with the LCIA Rules within one year after the date that the user asserting the Claim first found out or reasonably should have found out the alleged act, omission or default giving rise to the Claim ("Limitation Period"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Limitation Period shall include the Dispute Resolution Period set out at clause 27.1. There shall be no right to any remedy or relief for any Claim by the user if the Notice of Arbitration in respect of that Claim is not filed and served on Profiteer within that Limitation Period. If the Limitation Period is contrary to applicable law, the user shall be required to bring any Claim against Profiteer within the shortest time period permitted by the applicable law. A Notice of Arbitration should be served on Profiteer in accordance with the Applicable Laws and rules of service.

27.12. The parties agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential. The existence of the arbitration, the existence or content of the Claim, all documents and information provided or exchanged in connection with the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards made in the arbitration shall be kept confidential and no party shall disclose any of the foregoing to any third party except the tribunal, the LCIA, the parties, their counsels, experts, witnesses, accountants and auditors, insurers and reinsurers, and any other persons necessary to the conduct of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose such confidential information:

- if the written consent of the other party is obtained;

- to the extent required by applicable law or by the regulations of any regulatory or supervisory authority of competent jurisdiction to which the party is or may become subject to or pursuant to any order of court or other competent authority or tribunal of competent jurisdiction;

- in connection with the commencement, pursuit or defence by a party of any bona fide legal proceedings to enforce or challenge any award rendered in the arbitration; and

- to the extent that the relevant confidential information is in the public domain otherwise than by breach of this agreement.

27.13. This term of confidentiality in this clause shall survive termination of these Terms and conclusion or stay of any arbitration brought pursuant to these Terms.

## 28. Class Action Waiver
You and Profiteer agree that any Claims shall be brought against Profiteer in an arbitration on an individual basis only and not as a plaintiff or class member in a purported class or representative action. You further agree to waive any right for such Claims to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action, to the extent permissible by applicable law. Combining or consolidating individual arbitrations into a single arbitration is not permitted without the consent of Profiteer.
